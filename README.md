In this project, I conducted various analyses on a supermarket dataset and visualized the results. I used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work with the data.

Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and handling missing values
Data Analysis: Examining sales trends and customer segments
Visualization: Presenting the data through graphs and charts
